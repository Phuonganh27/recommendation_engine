# Recommendations with IBM

## Project Motivation

Within the IBM Watson Studio, an expansive collaborative community ecosystem exists, encompassing articles, datasets, notebooks, and other AI and ML assets. Users within this platform interact with these assets, offering a rich opportunity to enhance their experiences by connecting them with the most relevant resources. This project has been undertaken to personalize the user experience through the development of a recommendation system.

## Introduction

This project focuses on the analysis of user interactions with articles within the IBM Watson Studio platform and the subsequent creation of recommendations. The aim is to suggest new articles that users are likely to find appealing. Below, you can find an example of what the dashboard could resemble, displaying articles within the IBM Watson Platform.

While the dashboard above currently showcases the most recent articles, envision a recommendation board offering articles highly pertinent to specific users.

The project is structured into the following tasks:

### I. Exploratory Data Analysis

Before proceeding with any recommendations, thorough data exploration is essential. This section delves into various aspects of the dataset, addressing fundamental questions that provide the groundwork for subsequent sections.

### II. Rank Based Recommendations

The initial step in creating recommendations involves identifying the most popular articles, primarily determined by the number of interactions. Given the absence of article ratings, we assume that articles with the highest interactions are the most popular, making them suitable recommendations for new users or anyone, depending on their known preferences.

### III. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering

To offer more tailored recommendations to IBM's platform users, we adopt a user-user collaborative filtering approach. This method involves identifying users who exhibit similarities in their interactions with articles. Subsequently, articles that these similar users have engaged with can be recommended to one another, aligning with the goal of delivering more personalized recommendations.

### IV. Matrix Factorization

The project concludes with the implementation of a machine learning-based approach to recommendations. Utilizing the user-item interaction data, a matrix decomposition is constructed. This decomposition allows us to predict new articles that an individual may interact with, even though the predictive accuracy may be imperfect. The final section discusses potential methodologies for further enhancement and strategies for assessing the effectiveness of our recommendations in engaging users.
